The Future of Drupal Functional Testing
=======================================

## Overview

This is your opportunity to shape the way we test Drupal!

In the Drupal 8 cycle we have invested alot of time into writing tests. We are now writing unit tests for our logic and acceptance tests for our scenarios, but what about our frontend (Javascript) testing?

Originally Drupal's WebTestBase evolved from SimpleTest but over the years it has morphed and transformed into a mutant beast of difficult to maintain custom code.

Whilst we've been off on our island, the PHP community at large have been working together on solving the same problems we've been adding additional band-aids and bolt-ons to SimpleTest for.

One such solution is Mink.
